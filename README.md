# Pets web app

An amazing Pets web app which you can access through https://nermeen-mattar.github.io/pets-web/

## Scope

The idea of the assignment is to develop an app that displays different types of `pets on a filter page`.

-   On this page, each pet profile should contain an `avatar picture, pet name, and a view option` to navigate to its own details page
-   On the top of the filter page there should be a `search option`, which performs a fuzzy search operation to filter pet results on the fly
-   At the bottom of the page you should show different `categories` for the pets
-   Use React hooks and build one custom hook (if possible)
-   State management (like redux, mobx, or recoil etc.) to store and share the data
-   Application should be responsive
-   Make it accessible and use Semantic HTML
-   Make it type safe
-   Use proper CSS naming conventions
-   Make your components reusable (Styled components)
-   Fetch data from given REST API endpoint
-   Ensure it works on modern browsers

_Bonus points:_

-   `Navigating to "pet details page" from "filter page"` to display pet information with its avatar picture
-   Support for `screen readers`

Note: All the information for your application can be obtained from REST API endpoint which are mentioned below.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜º
